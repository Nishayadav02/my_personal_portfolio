          <h3>Hello, I'm Nisha ðŸ‘‹</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a passionate and detail-oriented developer, currently in my final year of <span>B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering</span>. My main focus is on creating beautiful, functional, and fully responsive websites. I love bringing ideas to life in the browser and have a strong foundation in modern <span>frontend technologies</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To complement my frontend skills, I am actively expanding my knowledge of <span>backend development</span>, aiming to become a well-rounded full-stack developer. I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges, especially those that allow me to solve real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I express my creativity through <span>art, enjoying sketching and painting</span>. This artistic side helps me approach my development work with a better eye for design and user experience. I am currently looking for <span>new opportunities</span> where I can contribute my skills and grow as a developer.
